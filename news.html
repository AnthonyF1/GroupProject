		<h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
		<p>After being released in 2004, World of Warcraft has consistently managed to maintain the largest active subscriber base of any MMO on the market. The game's initial fanbase was attracted due to the game being the latest installment of the highly popular Warcraft franchise, but its ongoing longevity showcases that there is a lot to love in World of Warcraft.</p>
		
		<h3>Final Fantasy XIV</h3>
		<p>After a particularly underwhelming launch of the original Final Fantasy XIV 1.0, the game was remade and re-released in 2013 as Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Since then, the game has enjoyed constant critical success as well as two major expansions.</p>
		
		<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>
		<p>Personally, I have spent many hours playing both of these games. If you have the time and money to spare I would highly recommend trying them both. If not, I hope that my advice helps you to choose an MMORPG that will provide you with innumerable hours of fun and happy memories.</p>

		<h2>Fortnite update: Patch notes for PS4, Xbox One performance lag FIX</h2>
		
		<p class="txtaligncenter">Post By: Anthony Forte - <span class="pinktxt">9/8/2018</span></p>
		
		<p>Fortnite has been given a new update on PS4 and Xbox One. While Epic Games is yet to reveal full patch notes, the studio confirmed that the new update would improve performance. "We have just released an update for PS4 and Xbox One that addresses performance issues," Epic Games told Twitter followers. The update appears to weigh in at around 1.77GB on PS4, but is smaller on Xbox One.</p>
		
		<p class="center"><img src="images/fortnite.jpg" alt="Fort Nite" class="center"></p>
		
		<p>Fans may need to restart the console when the update is complete, and won't be able to get online without it. The company has released multiple smaller updates in the past few days, primarily for PC, Mac and Android. Fortnite update 5.4 added a brand new Grappler gun, the High Stakes event and the Getaway limited time mode. The game files also contain a host of new skins and items, which will be released over the next two weeks.</p>
