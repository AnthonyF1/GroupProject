		<p>Fortnite has been given a new update on PS4 and Xbox One. While Epic Games is yet to reveal full patch notes, the studio confirmed that the new update would improve performance. "We have just released an update for PS4 and Xbox One that addresses performance issues," Epic Games told Twitter followers. The update appears to weigh in at around 1.77GB on PS4, but is smaller on Xbox One.</p>

		<p>Fans may need to restart the console when the update is complete, and won't be able to get online without it. The company has released multiple smaller updates in the past few days, primarily for PC, Mac and Android. Fortnite update 5.4 added a brand new Grappler gun, the High Stakes event and the Getaway limited time mode. The game files also contain a host of new skins and items, which will be released over the next two weeks.</p>
